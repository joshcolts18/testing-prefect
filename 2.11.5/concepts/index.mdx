| __[Deployments](/2.11.5/concepts/deployments)__           | A server-side concept that encapsulates a flow, allowing it to be scheduled and triggered via API. |

| __[States](/2.11.5/concepts/states)__                     | The status of a particular task run or flow run.                                                                            |
| __[Blocks](/2.11.5/concepts/blocks)__                     | Prefect primitives that enable the storage of configuration and provide a UI interface.                                     |
| __[Task Runners](/2.11.5/concepts/task-runners)__         | Enable you to engage specific executors for Prefect tasks, such as concurrent, parallel, or distributed execution of tasks. |
